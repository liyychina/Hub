            <p class="right-paragraph" id="product-paragraph">
                <br>A food processor is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate repetitive tasks in the preparation of food. Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as "food processors". Food processors are similar to blenders in many forms. A food processor typically requires little to no liquid during use, and even its finely chopped products retain some texture. A blender, however, requires a set amount of liquid in order for the blade to properly blend the food, and its output is also more liquidy. Food processors are used to blend, chop, dice, and slice, allowing for quicker meal preparation.
    
    </br>
                <br>Food processors normally have multiple functions, depending on the placement and type of attachment or blade. Some of the more challenging tasks include kneading stiff doughs, chopping raw carrots, and shredding a hard cheese, which may require a more powerful motor. Accessories such as blender and juicer attachments may allow a food processor to perform the duties of other appliances.</br>
                <br>The base of the unit houses a motor which turns a vertical shaft. A bowl, usually made of transparent plastic, fits around the shaft. Cutting blades can be attached to the shaft; these fit so as to operate near the bottom of the bowl. Shredding or slicing disks can be attached instead; these spin near the top of the bowl. A lid with a "feed tube" is then fitted onto the bowl.
    </br>
                <br>The feed tube allows ingredients to be added while chopping or slicing. It also serves as a chute through which items are introduced to shredding or slicing disks. A "pusher" is provided, sized to slide through the feed tube, protecting the user's fingers.
    Almost all modern food processors have safety devices which prevent the motor from operating if the bowl is not properly secured to the base or if the lid is not properly secured to the bowl.

        <h1>HAIR DRYER</h1>

            <p class="right-paragraph" id="product-paragraph">
                <br>A hair dryer, hairdryer or blow dryer is an electromechanical device that blows ambient or hot air over damp hair to speed the evaporation of water to dry the hair. Blow dryers enable better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds within each strand. These bonds are powerful (allowing stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair. Hairstyles using blow dryers usually have volume and discipline, which can be further improved with styling products, hairbrushes, and combs during drying to add tension, hold and lift.
    
    </br>
                <br>Blow dryers were invented in the late 19th century. The first, stationary, model was created by Alexandre F. Godefroy in his salon in France. The handheld, household hair dryer first appeared in 1920. Blow dryers are used in beauty salons by professional stylists and in the household by consumers. Most hair dryers consist of electric heating coils and a fan that blows the air (usually powered by a universal motor). The heating element in most dryers is a bare, coiled nichrome wire that is wrapped around mica insulators. Nichrome is used due to its high resistivity, and low tendency to corrode when heated.
    </br>
                <br>A survey of stores in 2007 showed that most hair dryers had ceramic heating elements (like ceramic heaters) because of their "instant heat" capability. This means that it takes less time for the dryers to heat up and for the hair to dry. Many of these dryers have "normal mode" buttons that turn off the heater and blow room-temperature air while the button is pressed. This function helps to maintain the hairstyle by setting it. The colder air reduces frizz and can help to promote shine in the hair.
    </br>
                <br>Many feature "ionic" operation, to reduce the build-up of static electricity in the hair,[4] though the efficacy of ionic technology is of some debate. Manufacturers claim this makes the hair "smoother". Hair dryers are available with attachments, such as diffusers, airflow concentrators, and comb nozzles.

                <br>A mixer (also called a hand mixer or stand mixer depending on the type) is a kitchen device that uses a gear-driven mechanism to rotate a set of "beaters" in a bowl containing the food or liquids to be prepared by mixing them. Mixers help automate the repetitive tasks of stirring, whisking or beating. When the beaters are replaced by a dough hook, a mixer may also be used to knead.

                <br>A rice cooker or rice steamer is an automated kitchen appliance designed to boil or steam rice. It consists of a heat source, a cooking bowl, and a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature of the cooking bowl and controls the heat. Complex, high-tech rice cookers may have more sensors and other components, and may be multipurpose.</br>
                <br>The term rice cooker formerly applied to non-automated dedicated rice-cooking utensils, which have an ancient history (a ceramic rice steamer dated to 1250 BC is on display in the British Museum). It now applies mostly to automated cookers. Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan, where they are known as suihanki (Japanese: 炊飯器, literally, "boil-rice-device". A basic rice cooker has a main body (pot), an inner cooking container which holds the rice, an electric heating element, and a thermostat.
    </br>
                <br>The bowl is filled with rice and water and heated at full power; the water reaches and stays at boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). When the water has all been absorbed, the temperature can rise above boiling point, which trips the thermostat. Some cookers switch to low-power "warming" mode, keeping the rice at a safe temperature of approximately 65 °C (150 °F); simpler models switch off; the rice has entered the resting phase.</br>
                <br>More advanced cookers may use fuzzy logic for more detailed temperature control, induction rather than resistive heating, a steaming tray for other foods, and even the ability to rinse the rice.</span>

                <br>A bread making machine or breadmaker is a home appliance for baking bread. It consists of a bread pan (or "tin"), at the bottom of which are one or more built-in paddles, mounted in the center of a small special-purpose oven. The machine is usually controlled by a built-in computer using settings input via a control panel. Most bread machines have different cycles for different kinds of dough—including white bread, whole grain, European-style (sometimes labelled "French"), and dough-only (for pizza dough and shaped loaves to be baked in a conventional oven). Many also have a timer to allow the bread machine to function without operator input, and some high-end models allow the user to program a custom cycle.</br>
                <br>Some breadmakers sold in the 1990s had vertical pans, some horizontal. Today, the vast majority available retail make horizontal loaves. For that reason, they produce a smaller, shorter loaf than their predecessors. It is more difficult to mix a long, horizontal loaf because the ends are distant from the mixer-paddle and gravity does not assist the distribution of the dough. Some machines attempt a better kneading by using two paddles, one at each end. The vertical loaf machine may require a higher powered motor, because the entire mass of the dough-ball is on the paddle as it kneads the dough against the nearby sides of the loaf-pan.

                <br>A juicer, also known as a juice extractor, is a tool used to extract juice from fruits, herbs, leafy greens and other types of vegetables in a process called juicing. It crushes, grinds, and/or squeezes the juice out of the pulp. A juicer clarifies the juice through a screening mesh to remove the pulp unlike a blender where the output contains both the liquids and solids of the processed fruit(s) or vegetable(s).</br>
                <br>Some types of juicers can also function as a food processor. Most of the twin gear and horizontal masticating juicers have attachments for crushing herbs and spices, extruding pasta, noodles or bread sticks, making baby food and nut butter, grinding coffee, making nut milk, etc.
    </br>
                <br>Squeezers are used for squeezing juice from citrus such as grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges. Juice is extracted by pressing or grinding a halved citrus along a juicer's ridged conical center and discarding the rind. Some reamers are stationary and require a user to press and turn the fruit, while others are electrical, automatically turning the ridged center when fruit is pressed upon.
    </br>
                <br>A centrifugal juicer cuts up the fruit or vegetable with a flat cutting blade. It then spins the produce at a high speed to separate the juice from the pulp. A masticating juicer known as cold press juicer or slow juicer uses a single auger to compact and crush produce into smaller sections before squeezing out its juice along a static screen while the pulp is expelled through a separate outlet.

            <p class="right-paragraph" id="product-paragraph">
                <br>Grilling is a form of cooking that involves heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above, below or from the side. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), using a cast iron/frying pan, or a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill).
    </br>
                <br>Heat transfer to the food when using a grill is primarily through thermal radiation. Heat transfer when using a grill pan or griddle is by direct conduction. In the United States, when the heat source for grilling comes from above, grilling is called broiling. In this case, the pan that holds the food is called a broiler pan, and heat transfer is through thermal radiation.
    </br>
                <br>Direct heat grilling can expose food to temperatures often in excess of 260 °C (500 °F). Grilled meat acquires a distinctive roast aroma and flavor from a chemical process called the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction only occurs when foods reach temperatures in excess of 155 °C (310 °F).
    </br>
                <br>Studies have shown that cooking beef, pork, poultry, and fish at high temperatures can lead to the formation of heterocyclic amines, benzopyrenes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are carcinogens. Marination may reduce the formation of these compounds. Grilling is often presented as a healthy alternative to cooking with oils, although the fat and juices lost by grilling can contribute to drier food.</span>

                <br>An espresso machine brews coffee by forcing pressurized water near boiling point through a "puck" of ground coffee and a filter in order to produce a thick, concentrated coffee called espresso. Multiple machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements, such as a grouphead and a portafilter. An espresso machine may also have a steam wand which is used to steam and froth liquids (such as milk) for coffee drinks such as cappuccino and caffè latte.</br>
                <br>Espresso machines may be steam-driven, piston-driven, pump-driven, or air-pump-driven. Machines may also be manual or automatic. Numerous machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements.
    </br>
                <br>A grouphead (or group head) is the receiver for the removable portafilter (or group handle). A typical consumer espresso machine normally has only one grouphead, while popular professional machines, such as those used at commercial coffee shops, can contain anywhere from one to seven. During the process of extracting a shot of espresso, hot water is forced through the grouphead under pressure. The grouphead contains many holes (the shower) that attempt to distribute the pressurised water evenly over the surface of the grinds in the portafilter basket and thereby achieve an even cross sectional flow.
    <br>
    <br>A portafilter (or group handle) attaches to the grouphead of semi-automatic and piston-driven espresso machines, and carries a tamped puck of coffee grounds within its basket. It is usually made of brass for better heat retention, and is attached by a plastic or wooden handle. The portafilter forms a seal with the espresso machine's gasket, and directs high-pressure hot water through the coffee puck. After-market retailers also sell bottomless portafilters that minimize the espresso's contact with any metal. A bottomless portafilter is one tool baristas use to analyze the quality of the coffee grind and the evenness of the extraction and allows for a visual check of "channeling" or the condition in which water is able to pierce a hole in the espresso puck during the brew process leading to poor extraction. Often, baristas use knockboxes to store their spent espresso grounds after they have pulled a shot.

                <br>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties. Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and frozen</br>
                <br>Waffle machines, also known as waffle makers or waffle irons, are kitchen appliances designed specifically for making waffles. They come in different types, such as stove-top irons, electric machines with non-stick plates, and industrial-grade waffle makers used in commercial settings like restaurants and hotels. or a waffle machine: Preparing Waffle Batter: Use a basic waffle batter recipe comprising flour, baking powder, eggs, milk, sugar, and butter. Mix the ingredients until you achieve a smooth consistency. You can also customize the batter by adding flavorings like vanilla extract or spices like cinnamon.
    </br>
                <br>Preheating the Waffle Iron: Heat the waffle machine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most electric waffle makers have indicator lights that signal when they're adequately heated and ready for use. Greasing or Spraying: To prevent sticking, lightly grease or spray the waffle plates with oil or cooking spray before pouring the batter.

                <br>A can opener (North American and Australian English) or tin opener (British English) is a mechanical device used to open metal tin cans. Although preservation of food using tin cans had been practiced since at least 1772 in the Netherlands, the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States. These early openers were basically variations of a knife, though the 1855 design continues to be produced.
    </br>
                <br>The can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating cutting wheel that runs round the can's rim to cut open the lid was invented in 1870, but was considered very difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer. A more successful design came out in 1925 when a second, serrated wheel was added to hold the cutting wheel on the rim of the can. This easy-to-use design has become one of the most popular can opener models.
    </br>
                <br>Around the time of World War II, several can openers were developed for military use, such as the American P-38 and P-51. These featured a robust and compact design with a pull cutting blade hinged to a corrugated handle with a pivot. Electric can openers were introduced in the late 1950s and met with success. The development of new can opener types continues with a recent redesign of a side-cutting model.

                <br>An ice cream mixer, often referred to as an ice cream maker or churn, is a kitchen appliance used to create homemade ice cream. It's a device designed to churn and freeze a mixture of ingredients to produce a creamy frozen dessert. There are several types of ice cream mixers available:
    Manual Ice Cream Makers: These typically consist of a bowl that needs to be pre-frozen, a churn or paddle, and a hand crank or mechanism to churn the mixture manually. Users add their ice cream base into the frozen bowl and then churn it until it reaches the desired consistency.
    Electric Ice Cream Makers: These are powered by electricity and usually have a freezing unit built-in. They include an inner bowl that needs to be frozen in advance, a mixing paddle, and an electric motor that churns the mixture automatically. They're generally more convenient than manual models as they don't require hand-cranking.
    </br>
                <br>Compressor Ice Cream Makers: Unlike the previous types that require pre-freezing the bowl or other parts, compressor ice cream makers have a built-in freezer. They can continuously churn and freeze multiple batches of ice cream without the need for pre-freezing the bowl, allowing for faster and consecutive batches. Ice cream mixers allow users to control the ingredients, enabling them to create various flavors, cater to dietary restrictions, and experiment with different recipes. The basic process involves mixing a combination of cream, milk, sugar, flavorings, and sometimes eggs, and then churning the mixture until it thickens and freezes.
    </br>
                <br>Preparing the ice cream base by combining ingredients like cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings.
    Chilling the mixture in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Assembling the ice cream maker and turning it on to start churning. Pouring the chilled mixture into the mixer and allowing it to churn until it thickens and freezes to the desired consistency. Transferring the freshly churned ice cream to a container and freezing it further if a firmer texture is desired.
    </br>
                <br>Always refer to the user manual of your specific ice cream mixer for detailed instructions on its operation, cleaning, and maintenance.

                <br>A water dispenser is a device used to dispense water, typically providing either hot, cold, or room temperature water. It is commonly found in households, offices, schools, and public places.
    </br>
                <br>When using a water dispenser, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning, changing the water bottles (if applicable), and maintaining the unit to ensure clean and safe drinking water. Cooling and Heating Mechanisms: Dispensers have refrigeration or heating systems to cool or heat the water as desired.
    </br>
                <br>Filtration Systems: Point-of-Use dispensers often include water filtration systems to purify the water before dispensing. Design and Size: Water dispensers come in various sizes, from compact countertop models to freestanding units.
    </br>
    <br>A water dispenser, known as water cooler (if used for cooling only), is a machine that dispenses and often also cools or heats up water with a refrigeration unit. It is commonly located near the restroom due to closer access to plumbing. A drain line is also provided from the water cooler into the sewer system.
    
    Water dispensers come in a variety of form factors, ranging from wall-mounted to bottle filler water dispenser combination units, to bi-level units and other formats. They are generally broken up into two categories: point-of-use (POU) water dispensers and bottled water dispensers. POU water dispensers are connected to a water supply, while bottled water dispensers require delivery (or self-pick-up) of water in large bottles from vendors. Bottled water dispensers can be top-mounted or bottom-loaded, depending on the design of the model.
    
    Bottled water dispensers typically use 11- or 22-liter (5- or 10-gallon) dispensers commonly found on top of the unit. Pressure coolers are a subcategory of water dispensers encompassing drinking water fountains and direct-piping water dispensers. Water cooler may also refer to a primitive device for keeping water cool.</br>
    <br>The wall-mounted type is connected to the building's water supply for a continuous supply of water and electricity to run a refrigeration unit to cool the incoming water, and to the building's waste disposal system to dispose of unused water. Wall-mounted water coolers are frequently used in commercial buildings like hospitals, schools, businesses, and other facilities where a facility manager is present to monitor its installation and maintenance. In the standard wall-mounted cooler, also commonly referred to as a water fountain or drinking fountain, a small tank in the machine holds chilled water so the user does not have to wait for chilled water. Water is delivered by turning or pressing a button on a spring-loaded valve located on the top of the unit, that turns off the water when released. Some devices also offer a large button on the front or side. Newer machines may not have a button at all; instead, a sensor that detects when someone is near and activates the water. Water is delivered in a stream that arches up, allowing the user to drink directly from the top of the stream of water. These devices usually dispense water directly from the municipal water supply, without treatment or filtering. Wall mount water coolers come in a wide variety of styles, from recessed models to splash resistant, contoured basins protruding out from the wall, traditional rounded square edge designs, bottle filler and water cooler combination units, bi-level designs, with other features and options. These are sometimes installed to meet local, state or federal codes.</br>
    <br>Hot Water Safety Features: Dispensers that provide hot water often have safety features to prevent accidental burns, such as child locks or indicators. Ease of Maintenance: Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for hygiene and optimal functioning.

                <br>Popcorn makers, whether they're traditional stovetop pots, microwave popcorn bowls, or electric popcorn machines.
    Choose the right popcorn: Use high-quality popcorn kernels. There are various types available, such as yellow or white kernels, mushroom-shaped, butterfly-shaped, etc. Each type may produce slightly different popcorn.
    </br>
                <br>Preheat the popcorn maker: Depending on the type of popcorn maker you're using, preheat it accordingly. Electric popcorn machines usually have an on/off switch and might require a few minutes to warm up. For stovetop pots or microwave bowls, you might not need to preheat. Add oil or butter (optional): Some popcorn makers, especially stovetop pots, may require a small amount of oil or butter to help heat the kernels evenly and add flavor. Electric popcorn machines might have a built-in butter melting feature.
    </br>
                <br>Add popcorn kernels: Pour the desired amount of popcorn kernels into the popcorn maker. The quantity will depend on the size and capacity of your popcorn maker. Close/cover the popcorn maker: Ensure the lid is securely closed to prevent the popcorn from popping out. Start the popping process: Turn on the popcorn maker or place it in the microwave according to the instructions. For stovetop pots, you'll need to keep the pot over heat and shake it occasionally to prevent burning.
    </br>
                <br>Always follow the specific instructions that come with your popcorn maker for the best results and safety precautions. Cleaning instructions may also vary based on the type of popcorn maker you're using, so refer to the manual for proper maintenance.
    </br>
    <br>There are many different types of popcorn makers available on the market, but most of them are self-operating and only need the addition of oil, kernels, and any extra ingredients that might be used in the process to be added to the popcorn maker. Before you get popping you’ll have to figure out which kind you want to use and then follow the directions below. Keep reading to discover what you need to buy and how to use the different models so that you can pop your perfect bowl of popcorn. Most popcorn makers use either hot air or hot oil to pop your kernels. As you might have guessed, the air-popped popcorn uses hot air to make the popcorn kernels pop. This method of cooking isn’t as messy and it also creates popcorn that is lower in fat than oil-popped popcorn. The downside is that it can have more of a bland and slightly cardboardy taste and texture. Oil-popped popcorn is a method where the hot oil makes your delicious popcorn kernels pop. You can use the oil-popping method on the stovetop, with an electric popcorn maker, or with an old-fashioned, professional-style popcorn maker. The downside to oil-popped popcorn is that it is higher in fat, which makes it more of a mess to clean up afterward. But the flavor and crispy texture are so delicious that I think it’s worth using the oil method if you prefer that style. To make your perfectly popped bowl of popcorn you are going to want to have a few crucial items on hand.</span

                <br>A kettle, sometimes called a tea kettle or teakettle, is a device specialized for boiling water, commonly with a lid, spout, and handle. There are two main types: the stovetop kettle, which uses heat from a hob, and the electric kettle, which is a small kitchen appliance with an internal heating element.</br>
                <br>In countries with 200–240 V mains electricity, electric kettles are commonly used to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. The heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2–3 kW. This means that the current draw for an electric kettle is up to 13 A, which is a sizeable proportion of the current available for many homes: the main fuse of most homes varies between 20 and 100 amps. In countries with 120 V mains electricity, twice as much current is drawn for the same power.</br>
                <br>In modern designs, once the water has reached boiling point, the kettle automatically deactivates, preventing the water from boiling away and damaging the heating element. Electric kettles were introduced as an alternative to stovetop kettles in the latter part of the 19th century. In 1893 the Crompton and Co. firm in the United Kingdom started featuring electric kettles in their catalogue. However, these first electric kettles were quite primitive as the heating element couldn't be immersed in the water. Instead, a separate compartment underneath the water storage area in the kettle was used to house the electric heating element. The design was inefficient even relative to the conventional stove-top kettles of the time.</span>

                <br>Television (TV) is a telecommunication medium for transmitting moving images and sound. The term can refer to a television set, or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports.</br>
                <br>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the 1920s, but only after several years of further development was the new technology marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white television broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the U.S. and most other developed countries.</br>
                <br>The availability of various types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, high-capacity hard disk drives, CDs, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video-on-demand service by Netflix). In the late 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in different formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer and Hulu.</span>
